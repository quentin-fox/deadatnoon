<p><b>August 18, 2014 &mdash;</b> I will take my life today around noon. It is time. Dementia is taking its toll and I have nearly lost myself. I have nearly lost <i>me</i>. Jonathan, the straightest and brightest of men, will be at my side as a loving witness.</p>

<p>I have known that I have dementia, a progressive loss of memory and judgment, for three years. It is a stealthy, stubborn and oh-so reliable disease. I might have preferred an exotic ailment whose name came trippingly off the tongue, but no, what I have is entirely typical. I find it a boring disease, and despite the sweetness and politeness of my family I am bright enough to be aware of how boring they find it, too. It is so rough on my husband, Jonathan. I don&#39;t think my lovely cat has noticed, but I&#39;m not sure.</p>

<p>Dementia gives no quarter and admits no bargaining. Research tells us that it&#39;s a &ldquo;silent disease,&rdquo; one that can lurk for years or even decades before its symptoms become obvious. Ever so gradually at first, much faster now, I am turning into a vegetable. I find it hard to keep in my mind that my granddaughter is coming in three day&#39;s time and not today. &ldquo;Where do we keep the X?&rdquo; (coffee / milkshake-maker / backspace on my keyboard / the book I was just reading) happens all the time. I have constantly to monitor what I say in an attempt not to make some gross error of judgment.</p>

<p>There comes a time, in the progress of dementia, when one is no longer competent to guide one&#39;s own affairs. I want out before the day when I can no longer assess my situation, or take action to bring my life to an end. There could also come a time when I simply must make a decision based on my deteriorating physical health. I do not like hospitals&mdash;they are dirty places. Any doctor will tell you to stay out of them if you possibly can. I would not want a fall, a stroke, or some unforeseen complication to mess up my decision to cost Canada as little as possible in my declining years.</p>

<p>Understand that I am giving up nothing that I want by committing suicide. All I lose is an indefinite number of years of being a vegetable in a hospital setting, eating up the country&#39;s money but having not the faintest idea of who I am.</p>

<p>Each of us is born uniquely and dies uniquely. I think of dying as a final adventure with a predictably abrupt end. I know when it&#39;s time to leave and I do not find it scary.</p>
